Summary of paper in a few sentences: 

The paper provide a review of the field and tries to assess the limitations of conflict forecasting (especially in regard to conflict onset).

Reasons to accept: 

I have read the manuscript `Conflict Forecasting and it Limits' with great interest and there is much to like about the manuscript. I recommend publication condition on minor changes that I will outline below:

1) I think the manuscript has to be more transparent about the fact that many conclusions in regard to the predictability of conflict relate mainly conflict onset. This is never explicitly stated, but especially during the interesting differentiation between clocks, clouds, and black swans this becomes obvious. Another way to address this would be to evaluate whether one could put different conflict variables (conflict escalation, duration, occurrence, outcome, or location of conflict) in different categories of predictability. E.g. location might be more of a clock like mechanism, while onset might be a black swan. E.g. Ward et al. 2013 focus on the occurrence of conflict and can present fairly good prediction performance.

2) I would like the author to expand a bit on how outcomes that cannot be predicted can be explained (p2).

3) I think there are several claim in the paper that need to be backed up with citations. E.g.:
- p2: `Prediction has typically been considered as unscientific' (by whom?)
- p2: `..papers that strongly improve prediction... are routinely rejected' (is that personal experience or actually happening?)
- p3: mentions work on neural networks that provide accurate prediction. Is this Phil Schrodt's work?
- p4: 'the fields of international conflict and civil war, the majority of the this work has until recently relied on structural variables' (citations are missing)
- p4: citations for ICEWS and TABARI are missing (see below for reference)
- p5: `more generally on news-based sources, have scored some predictive successes' (there need to be more citations and especially earlier work on this. See citations below)

4) On page 8 there is a discussion that it might be harder to attain point precision forecasts when actors behave strategic. I agree with this assessment, but strategic models will be able to provide us with a probability space of behavior that could be leveraged in forecasts. This related to a more general point: The manuscript generally focuses more on point predictions than on probability forecasts. It is not clear why the manuscript focuses on point predictions.

5) I think the manuscript is generally ignoring some of the foundational work on conflict forecasting and also some important current contributions. I am providing a list of important contributions that should be integrated into the manuscript to provide a fair assessment about the successes in forecasting. This can demonstrate that the field has made incredible advances, which might provide a more positive outlook on what we might be able to do in the future:
